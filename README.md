Malcolm Malloy's Portfolio

Before I joined GitHub (08-12-2016) I have been working on a portfolio website that will demonstrate my coding abilities to potential employers.

To begin the project I am reading through 'HTML5: Digital Classroom' by Jeremy Osborn to ensure that all my code follows best HTML5/CSS3 practices.
